    Submissions and Control:
    
    The techniques emphasize submissions and positional control, allowing you to neutralize threats without relying on striking.
    <br>
    <br>
    Focus on Technique Over Strength:

    <br>
    <br>
    Realistic Sparring:

    Mental Resilience:
    
    BJJ teaches patience, problem-solving, and mental toughness, which can help you remain calm and think clearly in stressful situations.

    Cons of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ)
    Limited Striking Skills:
    
    BJJ does not include striking techniques, which may leave you unprepared for situations where punches or kicks are involved.
    <br>
    <br>
    Ground-Focused:
    
    While effective on the ground, if a confrontation starts standing up and goes to the ground, you may be at a disadvantage against a trained striker.
    <br>
    <br>
    Injury Risk:
    
    There is a risk of injury during sparring, particularly with joint locks and submissions. Proper technique and safety measures are crucial to minimize this risk.
    <br>
    <br>
    Time Commitment:
    
    Mastery of BJJ techniques can take years of dedicated training, which might not align with everyoneâ€™s self-defense goals or time availability.
    <br>
    <br>
    Physical Conditioning:
    
    BJJ can be physically demanding, requiring good fitness levels, flexibility, and endurance, which may be challenging for some beginners.
    <br>
    <br>
    Possibility of Overreliance:
    
    Some practitioners may become overly reliant on grappling techniques, neglecting other important self-defense skills, such as striking and situational awareness.</p>
